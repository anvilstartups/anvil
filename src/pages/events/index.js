          In November 2018, The Anvil hosted Purdueâ€™s first social
          entrepreneurship competition. Named Crossing State Street,
          metaphorically bridging our campus, it consisted of multidisciplinary
          teams which created a business plan of a social enterprise. We
          partnered with Care For Friends, a nonprofit based in Chicago, to have
          a common goal, solving the communication between services and the
          homeless population.
