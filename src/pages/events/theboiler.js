          The Boiler Demo Day, held on <b>April 12, 2019</b>, will be showcase
          of our cohort's work. Each startup will present their final pitches to
          a panel of investors, entrepreneurs, and industry experts, and will
          have an opportunity to see detailed feedback on their pitches and
          business plan. The audience normally consists of angel investors,
          entrepreneurs, and more. Six judges will distribute equity-free
          funding to each of the top 5 teams.

          Startups in our cohort will attend workshops every other week.
          Programming will be focused on giving startups the tools necessary to
          have revenue by the end of the program. In addition, startups attend
          office hours, where startup founders meet with student and
          professional mentors. In the past, these office hours have been the
          key to holding founders accountable and pushing them to develop their
          business.
